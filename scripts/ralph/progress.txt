## Codebase Patterns
- Use ESLint v9 flat config in `eslint.config.js`; `.eslintrc.*` is ignored.
- Keep client and server TypeScript configs separate (`src/client/tsconfig.json` and `src/server/tsconfig.json`) and validate both in `npm run typecheck`.
- For numeric settings inputs, keep React state as strings for controlled fields and validate/coerce at submit time before persistence.
- For server uploads, attach per-request session metadata to the Express request before Multer runs, and always clean up the session temp directory immediately on failed upload paths.

- Implemented initial ScreenClone scaffold with Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind frontend, Express backend, shared types, and root tooling/scripts.
- Added dark-mode default landing UI with gradient `RalphTon` heading on `#1e1b2e`, plus backend CORS for `http://localhost:5173` and `/api/health` endpoint.
- Files changed: `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `.gitignore`, `.prettierrc`, `.prettierignore`, `eslint.config.js`, `postcss.config.cjs`, `tailwind.config.ts`, `tsconfig.base.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `src/client/index.html`, `src/client/vite.config.ts`, `src/client/tsconfig.json`, `src/client/src/App.tsx`, `src/client/src/main.tsx`, `src/client/src/index.css`, `src/client/src/vite-env.d.ts`, `src/server/index.ts`, `src/server/tsconfig.json`, `src/shared/types/index.ts`, `scripts/ralph/prd.json`, `scripts/ralph/progress.txt`.
- Quality checks:
  - `npm run typecheck` passed
  - `npm run lint` passed
  - `npm test` passed
  - Startup checks passed via timeout probes (`npm run dev` showed `http://localhost:5173`, `npm run server` showed `http://localhost:3001`)
- Image-analysis observation (UI story): Browser/image automation tools unavailable in this harness, so mockup-to-UI visual comparison is pending manual verification.
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - ESLint v9 in this repo requires flat config (`eslint.config.js`).
  - Port expectations are fixed by US-001: frontend `5173`, backend `3001`.
  - `timeout 20s` startup probes are a fast way to verify long-running dev scripts without hanging the iteration.

- Implemented the clone session settings form under the upload UI: project name, GitHub URL, GitHub token with show/hide toggle, max iterations, and target similarity.
- Added inline validation messages (required project name, URL format, iteration minimum, similarity range), disabled start conditions (requires project name + at least one uploaded image), and clone-running disabled form opacity state.
- Wired localStorage persistence for clone settings on submit and hydration on mount using key `ralphton-config`.
- Files changed: `src/client/src/App.tsx`, `scripts/ralph/prd.json`, `scripts/ralph/progress.txt`.
- Quality checks:
  - `mcp lsp_diagnostics_directory` passed (0 errors)
  - `npm run lint` passed
  - `npm run typecheck` passed
  - `npm test` passed (`No tests yet`)
- Image-analysis observation (UI story): Browser automation is not configured in this harness, so comparison against `/designs/mockups/us003.png` could not be executed; manual visual verification is required.
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Keep clone settings persistence shape aligned with controlled input state (`string` values) to avoid uncontrolled/number parsing issues.
  - Inline validation + toast errors can coexist: use inline for field-level issues and toast for workflow preconditions (e.g., missing uploads).

- Implemented Express multipart upload API with Multer: `POST /api/upload` now accepts up to 5 `screenshots` files, enforces 10MB/file, restricts MIME types (`image/png`, `image/jpeg`, `image/webp`), and writes files into per-request session temp directories under `/tmp/ralphton-{sessionId}` using UUIDv4 session IDs.
- Added backend reliability and safety handling around uploads: consistent JSON API errors (`{ error, code }`), stale temp directory cleanup for `ralphton-*` dirs older than 24h via interval task, immediate cleanup for failed/empty uploads, and image-signature validation (PNG/JPEG/WEBP magic bytes) so spoofed MIME uploads are rejected.
- Kept health contract intact and typed (`GET /api/health` returns `{ status: 'ok', version: '1.0.0' }`).
- Files changed: `src/server/index.ts`, `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `scripts/ralph/prd.json`, `scripts/ralph/progress.txt`.
- Quality checks:
  - `mcp lsp_diagnostics_directory` passed (0 errors)
  - `npm run lint` passed
  - `npm run typecheck` passed
  - `npm test` passed (`No tests yet`)
  - Runtime API verification passed via local `curl` probes for health, successful upload, no-files rejection, invalid-type rejection, too-many-files rejection, and spoofed MIME/content mismatch rejection.
- Image-analysis observation: Not applicable (backend API story, no UI changes).
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - For upload endpoints in this repo, initialize and stash request-scoped session metadata (`uploadSessionId`, `uploadSessionDir`) on `express-serve-static-core` request augmentation before invoking Multer storage callbacks.
  - Multer MIME filtering alone is insufficient for trust boundaries; add post-write magic-byte validation for allowed image formats and fail fast with cleanup.
  - On upload errors after directory creation, always remove the session directory immediately to avoid stale artifact buildup between interval cleanup runs.
