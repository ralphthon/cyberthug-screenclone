## Codebase Patterns
- Use ESLint v9 flat config in `eslint.config.js`; `.eslintrc.*` is ignored.
- Keep ESLint parser settings non-project-bound in this mixed workspace unless every TS file is covered by tsconfig references.
- Keep client and server TypeScript configs separate (`src/client/tsconfig.json` and `src/server/tsconfig.json`) and validate both in `npm run typecheck`.
- For image previews, keep canonical upload state as `File[]` and always revoke `URL.createObjectURL(...)` values in cleanup.
- For file picker flows, reset the hidden input value after handling `onChange` so re-selecting the same file still triggers an event.
- For numeric settings inputs, keep React state as strings for controlled fields and validate/coerce at submit time before persistence.
- For localStorage-backed forms, coerce parsed JSON through a typed sanitizer before hydrating state, and fall back to safe defaults for missing/invalid fields.
- For server uploads, attach per-request session metadata to the Express request before Multer runs, and always clean up the session temp directory immediately on failed upload paths.
- In TypeScript, Multer `diskStorage.destination` callbacks must still pass the second `destination` argument even on error paths to satisfy callback typing.
- For long-running backend workers, isolate orchestration in a manager class (spawn + ring buffer + fs.watch progress parsing) and always wire server `SIGTERM`/`SIGINT` to graceful child-process shutdown.
- For backend provider errors, never return raw upstream error bodies to clients; sanitize to status-level summaries to avoid accidental credential leakage.

## 2026-02-28 07:26:01 UTC - US-001
- Implemented initial ScreenClone scaffold with Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind frontend, Express backend, shared types, and root tooling/scripts.
- Added dark-mode default landing UI with gradient `RalphTon` heading on `#1e1b2e`, plus backend CORS for `http://localhost:5173` and `/api/health` endpoint.
- Files changed: `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `.gitignore`, `.prettierrc`, `.prettierignore`, `eslint.config.js`, `postcss.config.cjs`, `tailwind.config.ts`, `tsconfig.base.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `src/client/index.html`, `src/client/vite.config.ts`, `src/client/tsconfig.json`, `src/client/src/App.tsx`, `src/client/src/main.tsx`, `src/client/src/index.css`, `src/client/src/vite-env.d.ts`, `src/server/index.ts`, `src/server/tsconfig.json`, `src/shared/types/index.ts`, `scripts/ralph/prd.json`, `scripts/ralph/progress.txt`.
- Quality checks:
  - `npm run typecheck` passed
  - `npm run lint` passed
  - `npm test` passed
  - Startup checks passed via timeout probes (`npm run dev` showed `http://localhost:5173`, `npm run server` showed `http://localhost:3001`)
- Image-analysis observation (UI story): Browser/image automation tools unavailable in this harness, so mockup-to-UI visual comparison is pending manual verification.
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - ESLint v9 in this repo requires flat config (`eslint.config.js`).
  - Port expectations are fixed by US-001: frontend `5173`, backend `3001`.
- `timeout 20s` startup probes are a fast way to verify long-running dev scripts without hanging the iteration.

## 2026-02-28 07:31:53 UTC - US-002
- Implemented a drag-and-drop screenshot uploader on the main page with click-to-browse fallback, drag highlight behavior, file type/size validation, max 5 upload limit enforcement, and toast-style error messages.
- Added thumbnail preview grid (5 slots) with remove actions and placeholder boxes; previews preserve aspect ratio and removal correctly updates the upload counter and re-enables uploads.
- Prepared `FormData` payload from in-memory `File[]` state for future API upload integration.
- Files changed: `src/client/src/App.tsx`, `src/client/src/index.css`, `scripts/ralph/prd.json`, `scripts/ralph/progress.txt`.
- Quality checks:
  - `npm run lint` passed
  - `npm run typecheck` passed
  - `npm test` passed
- Image-analysis observation (UI story): No browser automation tool is configured in this harness, so reference mockup comparison against `/designs/mockups/us002.png` is pending manual verification.
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Keep upload constraints centralized (`MAX_FILES`, allowed MIME set, max bytes) so both drop and browse paths share identical validation.
  - Generate preview object URLs from current files and revoke them on dependency cleanup to avoid memory leaks.
  - The drop zone should stay keyboard-accessible (`role=\"button\"`, Enter/Space handlers) even when it is primarily pointer-driven.
---

## 2026-02-28 07:42:23 UTC - US-003
- Implemented the clone session settings form under the upload UI: project name, GitHub URL, GitHub token with show/hide icon toggle, max iterations, and target similarity.
- Added inline validation messages (required project name, URL format, iteration minimum, similarity range), disabled start conditions (requires project name + at least one uploaded image), and clone-running disabled form opacity state.
- Wired localStorage persistence for clone settings on submit and hydration on mount using key `ralphton-config`.
- Files changed: `src/client/src/App.tsx`, `scripts/ralph/prd.json`, `scripts/ralph/progress.txt`.
- Quality checks:
  - `mcp lsp_diagnostics_directory` passed (0 errors)
  - `npm run lint` passed
  - `npm run typecheck` passed
  - `npm test` passed (`No tests yet` placeholder script)
- Image-analysis observation (UI story): Browser automation is not configured in this harness, so comparison against `/designs/mockups/us003.png` could not be executed; manual visual verification is required.
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Keep clone settings persistence shape aligned with controlled input state (`string` values) to avoid uncontrolled/number parsing issues.
  - Inline validation + toast errors can coexist: use inline for field-level issues and toast for workflow preconditions (e.g., missing uploads).
---

## 2026-02-28 08:01:41 UTC - US-004
- Implemented Express multipart upload API with Multer: `POST /api/upload` now accepts up to 5 `screenshots` files, enforces 10MB/file, restricts MIME types (`image/png`, `image/jpeg`, `image/webp`), and writes files into per-request session temp directories under `/tmp/ralphton-{sessionId}` using UUIDv4 session IDs.
- Added backend reliability and safety handling around uploads: consistent JSON API errors (`{ error, code }`), stale temp directory cleanup for `ralphton-*` dirs older than 24h via interval task, immediate cleanup for failed/empty uploads, and image-signature validation (PNG/JPEG/WEBP magic bytes) so spoofed MIME uploads are rejected.
- Kept health contract intact and typed (`GET /api/health` returns `{ status: 'ok', version: '1.0.0' }`).
- Files changed: `src/server/index.ts`, `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `scripts/ralph/prd.json`, `scripts/ralph/progress.txt`.
- Quality checks:
  - `mcp lsp_diagnostics_directory` passed (0 errors)
  - `npm run lint` passed
  - `npm run typecheck` passed
  - `npm test` passed (`No tests yet`)
  - Runtime API verification passed via local `curl` probes for health, successful upload, no-files rejection, invalid-type rejection, too-many-files rejection, and spoofed MIME/content mismatch rejection.
- Image-analysis observation: Not applicable (backend API story, no UI changes).
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - For upload endpoints in this repo, initialize and stash request-scoped session metadata (`uploadSessionId`, `uploadSessionDir`) on `express-serve-static-core` request augmentation before invoking Multer storage callbacks.
  - Multer MIME filtering alone is insufficient for trust boundaries; add post-write magic-byte validation for allowed image formats and fail fast with cleanup.
- On upload errors after directory creation, always remove the session directory immediately to avoid stale artifact buildup between interval cleanup runs.

## 2026-02-28 08:40:40 UTC - US-006
- Implemented `RalphProcessManager` for per-session ralph loop orchestration with required APIs: `start(sessionId, config)`, `stop(sessionId)`, `getStatus(sessionId)`, and `getOutput(sessionId, lastN)`.
- Added session runtime preparation that generates per-session `prd.json`, seeds `progress.txt`, copies ralph runtime assets, and spawns `ralph.sh --tool omx --images-dir <session-images-dir> <maxIterations>` in an isolated workspace.
- Added child-process stdout/stderr capture with a 500-line ring buffer, stdout iteration parsing (`Ralph Iteration N of M`), completion detection via `<promise>COMPLETE</promise>`, and progress-tail parsing via `fs.watch` + byte-safe incremental reads to emit `iteration-complete` events.
- Enforced session lifecycle state progression (`idle -> uploading -> analyzing -> cloning -> completed|failed`) with state-change events and a max concurrent session limit controlled by `RALPH_MAX_SESSIONS` (default 3).
- Wired backend graceful shutdown in `src/server/index.ts` so `SIGTERM`/`SIGINT` triggers manager shutdown and sends `SIGTERM` to all active child processes before server exit.
- Files changed: `src/server/ralphProcessManager.ts`, `src/server/index.ts`, `scripts/ralph/prd.json`, `scripts/ralph/progress.txt`.
- Quality checks:
  - `mcp lsp_diagnostics_directory` passed (0 errors)
  - `npm run lint` passed
  - `npm run typecheck` passed
  - `npm test` passed (`No tests yet`)
- Image-analysis observation: Not applicable (backend orchestration story, no UI changes).
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Keep progress tail offsets in bytes (`Buffer` slicing) instead of UTF-8 string indices to avoid multibyte truncation bugs.
  - Emit loop completion/failure events idempotently so stop + exit handlers do not double-publish terminal session events.
  - Treat runtime artifacts (`ralph.sh`, prompts, skills, per-session PRD/progress) as a copied per-session workspace to keep parallel clone sessions isolated.

## 2026-02-28 13:07:07 UTC - US-001
- Rebuilt the initial ScreenClone scaffold with a Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind frontend and a TypeScript Express backend, plus shared types under `src/shared/types`.
- Added required root scripts (`dev`, `server`, `dev:all`) and configured Tailwind dark mode (`class` strategy) with project colors (`primary`, `surface`, `card`).
- Implemented backend CORS for `http://localhost:5173` and `GET /api/health` returning `{ status: 'ok', version: '1.0.0' }`.
- Added baseline UI rendering `RalphTon` gradient text on dark `#1e1b2e` background.
- Files changed: `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `eslint.config.js`, `postcss.config.cjs`, `tailwind.config.ts`, `tsconfig.base.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `src/client/index.html`, `src/client/vite.config.ts`, `src/client/tsconfig.json`, `src/client/src/main.tsx`, `src/client/src/App.tsx`, `src/client/src/index.css`, `src/client/src/vite-env.d.ts`, `src/server/index.ts`, `src/server/tsconfig.json`, `src/shared/types/index.ts`, `scripts/ralph/prd.json`, `scripts/ralph/progress.txt`.
- Quality checks:
  - `mcp lsp_diagnostics_directory` passed (0 errors)
  - `npm run lint` passed
  - `npm run typecheck` passed
  - `npm test` passed (`No tests yet`)
  - `npm run build` passed
  - Startup probes passed (`timeout 15s npm run dev` exposed `http://localhost:5173`, `timeout 15s npm run server` exposed `http://localhost:3001`)
- Image-analysis observation (UI story): Browser/image automation tools were not available in this harness, so mockup comparison against supplied reference images is pending manual verification.
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Keep frontend/backend TS projects isolated and aggregate checks in root scripts (`build`, `typecheck`) to keep smoke checks predictable.
  - ESLint v9 flat config works well here, but avoid project-service coupling unless every TS file in the workspace is included in referenced tsconfigs.
  - Use timeout startup probes for long-running dev scripts to confirm port bindings without hanging iterations.

## 2026-02-28 13:16:05 UTC - US-002
- Implemented drag-and-drop screenshot upload UI on the main page with native drag events, click-to-browse fallback, and keyboard activation (Enter/Space) for accessibility.
- Added upload validation for accepted MIME types (`image/png`, `image/jpeg`, `image/webp`), max 10MB/file, and max 5 total files; invalid inputs now surface toast-style error messages.
- Added 5-slot thumbnail grid with per-image remove controls, drop-zone disable/re-enable behavior at max capacity, and `FormData` preparation from in-memory `File[]` state using `screenshots` field entries.
- Files changed: `src/client/src/App.tsx`, `scripts/ralph/prd.json`, `scripts/ralph/progress.txt`.
- Quality checks:
  - `mcp lsp_diagnostics_directory` passed (0 errors)
  - `npm run lint` passed
  - `npm run typecheck` passed
  - `npm test` passed (`No tests yet`)
  - `npm run build` passed
- Image-analysis observation (UI story): Compared implementation intent to `/designs/mockups/us002.png`; required uploader elements and dark styling are implemented, but automated browser screenshot diffing is not available in this harness, so final pixel-level verification remains manual.
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Keep upload pipeline state canonical as `File[]` and derive preview URLs and request `FormData` from that source-of-truth to avoid desynchronization.
  - For transient toast UX in React, keep timer IDs in refs and clear them on unmount to avoid stale state updates.
---
## 2026-02-28 13:22:22 UTC - US-003
- Implemented the clone session settings form below the uploader with dark card styling and required fields: project name, GitHub repo URL, GitHub token, max iterations, and target similarity.
- Added localStorage persistence and hydration using key `ralphton-config`, plus typed coercion for stored values to safely prefill controlled inputs.
- Added inline validation messages for project name (required), GitHub URL format, max iterations (integer >= 1), and target similarity (50-100).
- Added GitHub token show/hide toggle icon control, and wired start-button disable logic to require both project name and at least one uploaded image.
- Added clone-running state that disables the full form via `<fieldset disabled>` and opacity reduction after submit.
- Files changed: `src/client/src/App.tsx`, `scripts/ralph/prd.json`, `scripts/ralph/progress.txt`.
- Quality checks:
  - `mcp lsp_diagnostics` passed for `src/client/src/App.tsx` (0 errors)
  - `mcp lsp_diagnostics_directory` passed for project root (0 errors)
  - `npm run lint` passed
  - `npm run typecheck` passed
  - `npm test` passed (`No tests yet`)
  - `npm run build` passed
- Image-analysis observation (UI story): Compared implementation goals against `/designs/mockups/us003.png` and supplied references; required structure and controls are implemented, but automated browser screenshot diffing is not configured in this harness, so final pixel-level verification remains manual.
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - For persisted form state, coerce parsed localStorage payloads through a typed sanitizer before hydrating controlled inputs to avoid invalid stored shapes breaking form rendering.
  - Keep field-level errors in a keyed object and clear only the edited field on change for predictable inline validation UX.
---
## 2026-02-28 13:30:40 UTC - US-004
- Implemented the Express multipart upload API for `POST /api/upload` with Multer disk storage, request-scoped UUID session directories (`/tmp/ralphton-{sessionId}`), `screenshots` field handling, and JSON response payload `{ sessionId, files[] }`.
- Enforced upload validation and limits: MIME allowlist (`image/png`, `image/jpeg`, `image/webp`), max 10MB per file, max 5 files, and no-files rejection.
- Added robust server behavior: 24-hour stale temp directory cleanup via `setInterval`, immediate cleanup of failed upload sessions, and consistent JSON error format `{ error, code }` through centralized error middleware.
- Files changed: `src/server/index.ts`, `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `scripts/ralph/prd.json`, `scripts/ralph/progress.txt`.
- Quality checks:
  - `mcp lsp_diagnostics_directory` passed (0 errors)
  - `npm run lint` passed
  - `npm run typecheck` passed
  - `npm test` passed (`No tests yet`)
  - Runtime API probes passed (`/api/health`, successful upload, no-files 400, invalid-type 400, too-many-files 400)
- Image-analysis observation: Not applicable (backend API story, no UI changes).
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use module augmentation on `express-serve-static-core` `Request` for request-scoped upload metadata used by Multer destination callbacks.
  - Always remove partially-created upload session directories on failed validation paths to keep `/tmp/ralphton-*` clean between periodic cleanup sweeps.
---
## 2026-02-28 13:50:24 UTC - US-005
- Implemented `POST /api/analyze` with request validation for `{ sessionId, imageIndex? }`, 404 behavior for missing sessions, and typed JSON error responses for invalid requests and analysis failures.
- Added a new backend analyzer module with session image discovery, base64 encoding, structured vision prompt generation, provider fallback flow (OpenAI -> Anthropic when both are configured), and a 60-second analysis timeout.
- Added per-session analysis caching keyed by `sessionId` + `imageIndex` to prevent duplicate LLM calls for repeated requests in the same session context.
- Implemented OpenAI/Anthropic response parsing and normalization into the required schema:
  - `layout: { type, direction, sections[] }`
  - `colorPalette: { primary, secondary, background, text, accent }`
  - `components: [{ type, position, props[] }]`
  - `textContent`, `fonts`, `responsiveHints`
- Hardened failure-path security by sanitizing upstream provider errors to status-only details so response payloads never leak raw provider diagnostic bodies.
- Files changed: `src/server/index.ts`, `src/server/visionAnalyzer.ts`, `src/shared/types/index.ts`, `scripts/ralph/prd.json`, `scripts/ralph/progress.txt`.
- Quality checks:
  - `mcp lsp_diagnostics_directory` passed for project root (0 errors)
  - `npm run lint` passed
  - `npm run typecheck` passed
  - `npm test` passed (`No tests yet`)
  - `npm run build` passed
  - Runtime API probes passed for:
    - `GET /api/health` -> 200
    - `POST /api/analyze` with missing `sessionId` -> 400 `INVALID_REQUEST`
    - `POST /api/analyze` with unknown `sessionId` -> 404 `SESSION_NOT_FOUND`
    - `POST /api/analyze` with sample session and invalid provider keys -> 500 `ANALYSIS_FAILED` with retry metadata
- Image-analysis observation: Not applicable (backend API story, no UI changes).
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Keep vision model outputs normalized through a coercion layer before returning API responses so schema drift from providers does not break clients.
  - Cache expensive per-session analysis by request key (`sessionId` + image selector) to keep reconnect/reload workflows fast and reduce duplicate provider usage.
